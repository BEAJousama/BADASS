## 1. Fundamental Network Concepts

### 1.1 Layer 2 vs Layer 3 Networks

**Layer 2 Networks (Data Link Layer)**
- Operate at OSI Data Link Layer using MAC addresses (48-bit)
- Create single broadcast domains managed by switches
- Provide high-speed, low-latency local communication
- Use MAC address tables for forwarding decisions
- Limited to local network segments without routing
- Protocol examples: Ethernet, Token Ring, PPP
- Inefficient when scaled beyond certain size due to broadcast traffic

**Layer 3 Networks (Network Layer)**
- Operate at OSI Network Layer using logical IP addresses
- Connect multiple broadcast domains through routers
- Enable global connectivity through hierarchical addressing
- Use routing tables based on longest prefix match
- Support traffic control and policy-based routing
- Protocol examples: IP, ICMP, OSPF, BGP
- Provide foundation for internet connectivity

**Key Differences**

| Feature | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Primary Purpose | Local connectivity | Inter-network connectivity |
| Addressing | Physical (MAC) | Logical (IP) |
| Boundary | Broadcast domain | Routed network |
| Forwarding Table | MAC address table | Routing table |
| Lookup Key | Destination MAC | Destination IP |
| Topology | Flat (switching) | Hierarchical (routing) |
| Protocol Headers | Ethernet, 802.1Q | IP, ICMP |
| TTL/Hop Count | Not present | Present |
| QoS Capabilities | Limited (802.1p) | More robust (DSCP) |

### 1.2 Broadcast vs Multicast Traffic

**Broadcast Traffic**
- Sent to all devices within a broadcast domain
- Uses destination addresses:
  - Layer 2: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (MAC broadcast)
  - Layer 3: 255.255.255.255 (IPv4 limited broadcast)
- Every device must process broadcast packets
- Low efficiency in large networks
- Common uses include ARP requests, DHCP discovery, service announcements
- Limited by broadcast domains (typically VLANs)

**Multicast Traffic**
- Sent only to devices that have joined specific multicast groups
- Uses special address ranges:
  - Layer 2: 01:00:5E:xx:xx:xx (for IPv4 multicast)
  - Layer 3: 224.0.0.0/4 (IPv4) or FF00::/8 (IPv6)
- More efficient than broadcast - only interested devices receive traffic
- Requires group management protocols (IGMP for IPv4, MLD for IPv6)
- Common uses include video streaming, stock tickers, software distribution
- Essential for efficient BUM traffic handling in VXLAN BGP EVPN

**Key Differences**

| Feature | Broadcast | Multicast |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Target | All devices | Group of interested devices |
| Address Range | Single address | Large range of addresses |
| Subscription | Implicit (all receive) | Explicit (must join) |
| Network Impact | Higher | Lower |
| Scalability | Poor | Good |
| Control | Limited | Configurable |
| Protocols | Native to Ethernet/IP | IGMP, PIM, MLD |
| Filtering | Difficult | Manageable |

### 1.3 Network Devices: Switches and Bridges

**Switches**
- Layer 2 network devices connecting local devices using MAC addresses
- Create separate collision domains for each port
- Build MAC address tables by examining source MAC addresses
- Forward frames only to the port where destination MAC is located
- Support VLANs, STP, link aggregation, and QoS features
- Modern data center switches often support VXLAN and BGP EVPN
- Operate in different forwarding modes:
  - Store-and-forward: Complete frame validation
  - Cut-through: Reduced latency but no error checking
  - Fragment-free: Hybrid approach checking minimum frame size

**Bridges**
- Connect multiple network segments at Layer 2
- In modern contexts, usually software-based virtual switches
- Common in Linux as bridge interfaces (`brctl` or `bridge` commands)
- Forward frames based on learned MAC addresses
- Connect physical and virtual interfaces in a single broadcast domain
- Used in virtualization for VM/container connectivity
- Function as key components in VXLAN implementation

**Comparison**

| Feature | Switch | Bridge |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Implementation | Traditionally hardware | Often software |
| Scale | Many ports | Typically fewer interfaces |
| Performance | Hardware-optimized | Depends on CPU (if software) |
| Management | CLI, SNMP, API | OS commands, network tools |
| Modern Context | Physical network device | Virtual networking component |
| Spanning Tree | Often RSTP or MSTP | STP or RSTP |
| In VXLAN Context | Often acts as VTEP | Often connects VMs/containers to VXLAN |

## 2. Network Segmentation Technologies

### 2.1 VLAN Overview

Virtual LANs (VLANs) provide logical segmentation of Layer 2 networks, creating multiple broadcast domains on a single physical infrastructure.

**VLAN Fundamentals**
- Defined in IEEE 802.1Q standard
- 12-bit VLAN ID allows for 4,094 usable VLANs (1-4094)
- Adds a 4-byte tag to Ethernet frames
- Tag format includes:
  - 3 bits for priority (802.1p)
  - 1 bit for Canonical Format Indicator
  - 12 bits for VLAN ID

**VLAN Types**
- Data VLANs: Carry regular user traffic
- Management VLANs: For administrative traffic
- Native VLANs: Untagged traffic on trunk links
- Voice VLANs: For voice traffic with QoS prioritization

**VLAN Port Modes**
- Access Ports: Belong to a single VLAN, connect to end devices
- Trunk Ports: Carry multiple VLANs, typically connect between switches
- Hybrid Ports: Handle both tagged and untagged traffic for different VLANs

**Benefits of VLANs**
- Traffic isolation and security
- Broadcast domain control
- Flexible network design regardless of physical location
- Simplified network management
- Better resource utilization

**Limitations of VLANs**
- Maximum of 4,094 VLANs (inadequate for large multi-tenant environments)
- Geographic constraints within Layer 2 domains
- Spanning Tree inefficiencies (blocked links)
- Limited mobility across data centers
- Configuration complexity across multiple switches

### 2.2 VXLAN Architecture

Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) is an overlay network technology that encapsulates Layer 2 frames within UDP packets to extend Layer 2 domains across Layer 3 networks.

**VXLAN Fundamentals**
- Defined in RFC 7348
- Encapsulates Layer 2 Ethernet frames in Layer 3/4 (IP/UDP) packets
- Creates overlay networks on existing IP infrastructure
- Uses UDP port 4789 (IANA assigned)
- Adds 50 bytes of overhead to original frames
- Requires increased MTU (typically 1550 bytes or more)

**VXLAN Components**
- VTEP (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint):
  - Performs encapsulation/decapsulation
  - Maps MAC addresses to remote VTEPs
  - Can be physical switches or software implementations

- VNI (VXLAN Network Identifier):
  - 24-bit identifier supporting up to 16 million virtual networks
  - Equivalent to VLAN ID with much larger namespace
  - Carried in VXLAN header

- Transport Network:
  - Underlying IP network carrying VXLAN packets
  - Often uses ECMP for load balancing
  - Can span across data centers

**VXLAN Packet Format**
```
+-------------------------------+
| Outer Ethernet Header         |
+-------------------------------+
| Outer IP Header               |
+-------------------------------+
| Outer UDP Header              |
+-------------------------------+
| VXLAN Header (8 bytes, VNI)   |
+-------------------------------+
| Original Ethernet Frame       |
| (Inner Ethernet header + data)|
+-------------------------------+
```

**VXLAN Operation Modes**
- Flood and Learn: Traditional data plane learning
- Control Plane Driven: Using BGP EVPN for MAC/IP distribution
- Multicast-based: Using multicast groups for BUM traffic
- Head-end Replication: Unicast replication for environments without multicast

**Benefits of VXLAN**
- Massive scale (16 million VNIs vs. 4,094 VLANs)
- Layer 2 extension across Layer 3 boundaries
- Multi-tenancy support for cloud environments
- Workload mobility across physical locations
- Optimized traffic flow using ECMP routing

### 2.3 VLAN vs VXLAN Comparison

Understanding the differences between traditional VLANs and VXLAN helps in choosing the appropriate technology for specific network requirements.

| Feature | VLAN | VXLAN |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Scale** | 4,094 networks (12-bit ID) | 16 million networks (24-bit VNI) |
| **Transport** | Native Ethernet | IP/UDP encapsulation |
| **Header Size** | 4 bytes (802.1Q tag) | 50 bytes (all headers) |
| **Boundary Limitations** | Limited to Layer 2 domain | Can extend across Layer 3 boundaries |
| **Traffic Patterns** | Follows Spanning Tree | Follows IP routing (ECMP capable) |
| **MTU Requirements** | Standard Ethernet MTU | Requires larger MTU (typically +50 bytes) |
| **BUM Traffic Handling** | Native broadcast | Multicast, ingress replication, or EVPN |
| **Host Tracking** | MAC learning | MAC learning or BGP EVPN |
| **Multi-tenancy Support** | Limited by VLAN scale | Extensive |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Mobility** | Limited to Layer 2 domain | Cross-data center capable |
| **Controller Requirement** | No | Optional (BGP EVPN recommended) |

**When to Use VLAN**

## 4. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

### 4.1 BGP Fundamentals

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol that enables the internet to function by connecting autonomous systems and implementing policy-based routing decisions.

**BGP Key Characteristics**
- Path vector protocol using TCP (port 179) for reliable delivery
- Incremental updates rather than periodic refreshes

  - Usually directly connected
  - TTL typically set to 1
  - AS number changes between peers

- **IBGP**: Internal BGP within the same autonomous system
  - Not required to be directly connected
  - TTL often set higher or to maximum
  - Same AS number for all peers
  - Requires full mesh or route reflectors/confederations

**BGP Message Types**
- **OPEN**: Establishes BGP session
- **UPDATE**: Advertises or withdraws routes
- **KEEPALIVE**: Maintains session liveness
- **NOTIFICATION**: Indicates errors and terminates sessions
- **ROUTE-REFRESH**: Requests resending of routes

**BGP Path Attributes**

- Data center fabrics with ECMP
- Network virtualization with BGP EVPN
- Service provider edge routing

### 4.2 BGP Path Selection

BGP path selection is the process by which routers choose the best path to a destination from multiple available paths using a complex decision process involving multiple attributes.

**BGP Best Path Selection Algorithm**

BGP evaluates paths in the following order:

1. Highest WEIGHT (Cisco proprietary, local to router)
2. Highest LOCAL_PREF (higher values preferred)
3. Locally originated routes (network, aggregate, redistribution)
4. Shortest AS_PATH (fewer AS hops)
5. Lowest ORIGIN type (IGP < EGP < Incomplete)
6. Lowest MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)
7. EBGP over IBGP paths (external preferred over internal)
8. Lowest IGP metric to next-hop
9. Oldest path (for EBGP paths)
10. Lowest Router ID (for IBGP paths)
11. Lowest Neighbor Address

This process continues until a single best path is selected or a tie remains (in which case, load balancing may be possible if supported).

**Key BGP Path Attributes in Detail**

- **WEIGHT** (Cisco-specific):
  - Local to the router, not advertised to peers
  - Range: 0-65535, higher is preferred
  - Used for influencing outbound traffic

- **LOCAL_PREF**:
  - Used within an AS to influence path selection
  - Range: 0-4294967295, higher is preferred
  - Propagated to all IBGP peers
  - Used for outbound traffic engineering

- **AS_PATH**:
  - Sequence of AS numbers traversed by the route
  - Prevents routing loops
  - Shorter paths preferred
  - Can be manipulated with AS_PATH prepending

- **ORIGIN**:
  - Indicates how the route was introduced into BGP
  - IGP (i): Most preferred, from network statement
  - EGP (e): From External Gateway Protocol (historical)
  - Incomplete (?): Least preferred, origin unclear

- **MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)**:
  - Suggests to external AS which ingress path to use
  - Range: 0-4294967295, lower is preferred
  - Used for inbound traffic engineering

**BGP Path Selection in EVPN Environments**

In BGP EVPN networks, additional considerations affect path selection:

- Route Type: Different EVPN route types processed according to purpose
- Layer 2 vs Layer 3: Path selection differs for bridging vs. routing
- ESI (Ethernet Segment Identifier): Used for multi-homing
- Sequence Numbers: For MAC mobility between VTEPs
- Extended Communities: Carry special attributes for EVPN function

### 4.3 Route Reflection

Route reflection is a BGP mechanism designed to overcome the full-mesh IBGP scaling problem, where each IBGP router must peer with every other IBGP router in the autonomous system.

**The Full-Mesh Problem**
- In standard BGP deployments, all IBGP routers must be fully meshed
- Number of IBGP sessions required: n(n-1)/2 (where n is the number of routers)
- A network with 100 routers would require 4,950 IBGP sessions
- This becomes impractical for large networks

**Route Reflection Solution**
- Defined in RFC 4456
- Adds hierarchy to IBGP to reduce the number of sessions
- Creates special IBGP speakers called Route Reflectors (RRs)
- Other IBGP routers become clients of the Route Reflectors
- Clients only peer with their Route Reflectors, not with each other

**Route Reflector Operation**

When a Route Reflector receives a route:
- From an IBGP client: Reflects to other clients and non-client IBGP peers
- From a non-client IBGP peer: Reflects to all clients only
- From an EBGP peer: Sends to all clients and non-client IBGP peers

**Route Reflector Cluster**
- **Cluster**: Group of Route Reflector and its clients
- **Cluster ID**: Unique identifier for a cluster (usually RR router ID)
- **CLUSTER_LIST**: BGP attribute that tracks clusters traversed by a route
- **ORIGINATOR_ID**: BGP attribute to identify the originator of a route

**Design Considerations**
- **Redundancy**: Deploy multiple Route Reflectors per cluster
- **Hierarchy**: Can create multiple levels of Route Reflectors
- **Placement**: Strategic placement in the network is important
- **Scaling**: Significantly reduces number of IBGP sessions
- **Loop Prevention**: Uses CLUSTER_LIST and ORIGINATOR_ID attributes

**Route Reflection in EVPN Networks**
- Route Reflectors are crucial for scalable EVPN control plane
- Often deployed as a pair for redundancy
- Usually placed in the fabric spine layer
- Handle large numbers of EVPN routes between leaf switches
- May be dedicated control plane devices (not forwarding traffic)

### 4.4 BGP in Service Provider Networks

BGP is the foundation of service provider networks, enabling internet connectivity, customer services, and internal infrastructure.

**Internet Routing**
- **Global Routing Table**: Managing routes to all internet destinations
- **Peering**: Direct exchange of routes between providers
  - Private Peering: Direct links between providers
  - Public Peering: Exchange points (IXPs) with multiple providers
- **Transit**: Purchased access to upstream provider routes
- **Route Filtering**: Critical for security and stability
  - RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)

  - Route Targets (RTs) for VPN membership control
- **L2VPN**: Layer 2 services over MPLS
  - VPWS (Virtual Private Wire Service)
  - VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service)
- **6PE/6VPE**: IPv6 transport over MPLS infrastructure

**Service Provider Internal Architecture**
- **Core (P) Routers**: MPLS label switching
- **Provider Edge (PE) Routers**: Service demarcation points
- **Route Reflectors**: Control plane scaling
- **Route Servers**: Centralized route distribution
- **Segment Routing**: Modern MPLS control plane

**Traffic Engineering with BGP**
- **AS Path Prepending**: Influencing inbound routing
- **Communities**: Signaling routing policies
- **BGP Local Preference**: Controlling outbound traffic
- **MED**: Influencing neighboring AS route selection
- **Flowspec**: Traffic filtering and rate limiting

## 5. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

### 5.1 OSPF Fundamentals

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol widely used as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) within autonomous systems.

**OSPF Protocol Characteristics**
- Link-state routing protocol with administrative distance 110 (Cisco)
- Uses cost as metric (inversely proportional to bandwidth)
- Runs Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm
- Standards: OSPFv2 (IPv4) RFC 2328, OSPFv3 (IPv6) RFC 5340
- Uses IP protocol 89 (no TCP/UDP port)
- Supports authentication: Plain text, MD5, SHA
- Link-state advertisements (not periodic updates)
- Fast convergence compared to distance vector protocols

**OSPF Operation**
1. **Neighbor Discovery**:
   - Hello packets establish adjacencies
   - Default Hello interval: 10 seconds (most networks)
   - Dead interval: 40 seconds (4 × Hello interval)

2. **Database Synchronization**:
   - Database Description (DBD) packets
   - Link State Request (LSR) packets
   - Link State Update (LSU) packets
   - Link State Acknowledgment (LSAck) packets

3. **Topology Calculation**:
   - Each router builds identical Link-State Database (LSDB)
   - Dijkstra's SPF algorithm calculates shortest paths
   - Results populate the routing table

**OSPF Network Types**
- **Broadcast Multi-Access**: Ethernet networks
  - Uses Designated Router (DR) and Backup DR (BDR)
  - Multicast communication (224.0.0.5, 224.0.0.6)

- **Point-to-Point**: Serial links, PPP, HDLC
  - No DR/BDR election
  - Simpler operation

- **Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA)**: Frame Relay, ATM
  - Requires special configuration
  - May use DR/BDR

- **Point-to-Multipoint**: NBMA networks configured differently
  - Treated as collection of point-to-point links
  - No DR/BDR election

**OSPF Router Types**
- **Internal Router**: All interfaces in the same area
- **Area Border Router (ABR)**: Interfaces in multiple areas
- **Backbone Router**: At least one interface in Area 0
- **Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR)**: Redistributes external routes

**OSPF in Data Center Networks**
- Used as underlay protocol for VTEP reachability in VXLAN fabrics
- Usually deployed as single-area design
- Often configured with faster timers for sub-second convergence
- Reduced adjacency formation for control-plane efficiency

### 5.2 OSPF Areas and Route Types

OSPF uses areas to create a hierarchical topology that improves scalability and reduces control plane overhead.

**OSPF Area Structure**
- **Area 0 (Backbone)**: Central transit area connecting all other areas
- **Standard Areas**: Connected directly to the backbone
- **Special Area Types**:
  - **Stub Area**: No external routes, default route used
  - **Totally Stubby Area**: No external or inter-area routes
  - **Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)**: Can import external routes but with limitations
  - **Totally NSSA**: Combines NSSA and Totally Stubby characteristics

**Benefits of OSPF Areas**
- **Reduced LSDB Size**: Each router only needs complete topology for its areas
- **Smaller Routing Tables**: Route summarization at area boundaries
- **Limited LSA Flooding**: Most LSAs confined to their originating area
- **Localized Recalculation**: SPF runs only when topology changes within an area
- **Improved Stability**: Issues in one area have limited impact on others

**OSPF LSA Types**
- **Type 1 (Router LSA)**: Describes router's links within an area
- **Type 2 (Network LSA)**: Generated by DR, describes all routers on a segment
- **Type 3 (Summary LSA)**: Inter-area routes generated by ABRs
- **Type 4 (ASBR Summary LSA)**: Routes to ASBRs
- **Type 5 (External LSA)**: Routes external to the OSPF domain
- **Type 7 (NSSA External LSA)**: External routes in NSSA areas

**OSPF Route Types**
- **Intra-Area Routes (O)**: Destinations within the same area
  - Most preferred
  - Derived from Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs
  
- **Inter-Area Routes (O IA)**: Destinations in other areas
  - Second preference
  - Derived from Type 3 LSAs
  
- **External Type 1 Routes (O E1)**: 
  - Third preference

2. Source VTEP receives frame and performs routing lookup
3. Source VTEP identifies destination subnet and remote VTEP
4. Source VTEP rewrites MAC headers for destination
5. Frame encapsulated with destination VNI
6. Destination VTEP performs L2 forwarding only
7. Frame delivered to destination host

**Symmetric IRB Flow**:
1. Source host sends frame to default gateway MAC
2. Source VTEP receives frame and performs routing lookup
3. Source VTEP routes packet to L3 VNI
4. Frame encapsulated with L3 VNI and sent to destination VTEP
5. Destination VTEP decapsulates and performs second routing lookup
6. Packet routed to destination L2 VNI
7. Frame delivered to destination host

**External Traffic Flows**

- **North-South Traffic** (DC to External):
  - Traffic between data center and external networks
  - Flows through border gateways
  - May use dedicated border leaf switches
  - Often involves NAT or firewall services
  - Uses standard BGP routing toward external networks

- **East-West Traffic** (Between DCs):
  - Traffic between different data centers
  - Can use EVPN Type 5 routes for prefix advertisement
  - May traverse dedicated DCI links
  - Often optimized for bandwidth efficiency

**Traffic Optimization Techniques**

- **ARP/ND Suppression**:
  - VTEPs respond to ARP/ND requests locally
  - Reduces broadcast traffic in overlay
  - Uses EVPN Type 2 routes with MAC+IP information

- **Unknown Unicast Suppression**:
  - Drops unknown unicast rather than flooding
  - Relies on control plane for MAC learning
  - Significantly reduces flooding in large networks

- **First-Hop Routing Optimization**:
  - Distributed anycast gateway
  - Same IP/MAC for default gateway across all VTEPs
  - Enables optimal routing at first hop
  - Eliminates suboptimal "gateway router" paths

### 9.3 BUM Traffic Handling

BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast) traffic handling is a critical aspect of VXLAN BGP EVPN networks, as efficient management of this traffic directly impacts network performance and scalability.

**BUM Traffic Types**

- **Broadcast Traffic**:
  - Destination MAC is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
  - Examples: ARP requests, DHCP discovery
  - Must reach all hosts in a broadcast domain (VNI)

- **Unknown Unicast Traffic**:
  - Destination MAC not in forwarding table
  - Traditional switches flood to learn location
  - Can be suppressed in EVPN environments

- **Multicast Traffic**:
  - Destination is a multicast group address
  - Examples: Streaming media, cluster heartbeats
  - Must reach all interested hosts in a VNI

**BUM Traffic Distribution Methods**

- **Ingress Replication (Unicast)**:
  - Source VTEP replicates packets to all remote VTEPs
  - Simple to implement (no multicast in underlay)
  - Less efficient for high-volume BUM traffic
  - EVPN Type 3 routes identify participating VTEPs
  - Scales with number of VTEPs (n-1 copies)

- **Multicast in Underlay**:
  - Maps each VNI to a multicast group
  - Uses PIM or other multicast protocol in underlay
  - More efficient for high-volume BUM traffic
  - Requires multicast support in underlay network
  - EVPN Type 3 routes include multicast group info

- **Assisted Replication**:
  - Specialized VTEPs act as replication servers
  - Source VTEP sends single copy to replicator
  - Replicator forwards to all other VTEPs
  - Balances efficiency and simplicity
  - Reduces load on edge VTEPs

**EVPN Type 3 Route for BUM Traffic**

- **Format**: `[3]:[0]:[32]:[Originator IP]`
- **Purpose**: Advertises VTEP participation in a VNI
- **Components**:
  - Route Distinguisher (RD)
  - Ethernet Tag ID (VNI)
  - IP Address of originating VTEP
  - Route Target based on VNI
- **Optional Attributes**:
  - PMSI Tunnel Attribute for multicast configuration
  - Import/export Route Targets

**BUM Traffic Optimization**

- **ARP/ND Suppression**:
  - VTEPs respond to ARP/ND requests locally
  - Eliminates need to flood these common broadcasts
  - Requires MAC+IP synchronized in control plane

- **Unknown Unicast Suppression**:
  - Drops unknown unicast frames instead of flooding
  - Relies on control plane for endpoint discovery
  - Significantly reduces overlay traffic

- **Selective Multicast**:
  - Only forwards multicast to interested VTEPs
  - Uses IGMP snooping with EVPN extensions
  - Requires EVPN IGMP routes (Types 6, 7, 8)

- **Designated Forwarder (DF) Election**:
  - For multi-homed segments
  - Prevents duplicate BUM traffic to same segment
  - Based on EVPN Type 4 routes
  - Prevents loops and duplication

**Configuration Considerations**

- **Underlay MTU**:
  - Must accommodate VXLAN encapsulation overhead
  - Particularly important for BUM traffic that may be large

- **Replication Limits**:
  - Hardware platforms may have limits on replication capacity
  - Important consideration for large-scale deployments

- **Control Plane Filtering**:
  - Route Targets control which VTEPs participate in which VNIs
  - Proper RT design prevents unnecessary BUM traffic

- **Failure Handling**:
  - Graceful handling of VTEP or link failures
  - Fast reconvergence for BUM distribution trees

## 10. Practical Deployment Considerations

### 10.1 Fabric Design and Topology

Proper fabric design is critical for a successful BGP EVPN VXLAN deployment, establishing the foundation for scalability, performance, and resilience.

**Common Data Center Topologies**
